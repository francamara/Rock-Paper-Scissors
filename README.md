# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project was made to refresh my memory on coding webpages and it was very fun. I would reccomend 100% to someone who is starting on this and would like to do a fun project to begin with.

With this code you can do whatever you want but if you give me some credit I would be very thankful!.

Send me an email if you do any modifications, or if it was useful, or whatever you want to say to me.
